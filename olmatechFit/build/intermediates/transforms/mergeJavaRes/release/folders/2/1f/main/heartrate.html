<h1>TARGET HEART RATE CALCULATORS – GENERAL AND KARVONEN</h1>
<p>These calculator used for maximizing effectiveness of cardio exercises by making sure that you are exercising hard enough to get a good workout, but not too hard to strain your heart.</p>
<p>Your target heart rate is a range expressed in percentage from your maximum heart rate (calculated based on your age when using the General Heart Rate Calculator, or on your age and resting heart rate in Karvonen calculator).</p>
<p>The ranges are split into five zones. Choose appropriate for you zone based on your fitness level. If you just recently started exercising, aim for the Maintenance zone (at 50% - 60%), if you are regular exerciser – Fitness / Fat burn zone (60% - 70%) would be right for you. If you are very active – Cardio training / Endurance zone (70% - 80%) will be good fit for you.</p>
