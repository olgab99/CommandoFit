<p>Welcome to <span class="bold">"Commando Fit"</span> - training program developed by personal trainer with more than 25 years of experience in fitness industry, and based on his personal experience, and experience of preparing his clients (military personnel, first responders and extreme sportsmen) to the physical demands of real life in extreme situations. This application is not a collection of exercise or workout programs, but  a full year training program which was used to bring many of his clients to new level of fitness. We hope that this application will help you to stay fit and be ready for whatever life will throw your way.</p>
<p>The program organized in blocks of seven days (pretty much as weeks – but you can start the program on any day of the week).  To achieve the best results - follow the program schedule, and most importantly, the order of workouts.  Additionally, you can do individual workouts outside of the program.</p>
<p>The application contains calendar with proposed training schedule and saved workout logs. You can email logs and post updates on Facebook.</p>
<p>As you progress, you should adjust your fitness level on Interview or Settings screen for application to calculate weight and number of repetitions values recommended for you.</p>
<p>The application includes various calculators that you will find useful during your training course.</p>
<p>Let us explore application functionality.</p>
<h1>MAIN APPLICATION SCREEN</h1>
<p>On this screen you can choose between doing Complete Exercise Program or just a separate workout. We recommend you to follow Complete Program scheduler, but if, for any reason, you feel like doing just a separate workout, you can choose from following modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bold">STRENGTH / ENDURANCE</span> – these workouts geared toward increasing endurance of your body. This achieved by lowering weights so you can do 12-18 repetitions in the each set.</li>
<li><span class="bold">MASS / STRENGTH</span> – these workouts geared toward building strength and size of  muscles by increasing weights so you can do 6-12 repetitions in the each set.</li>
<li><span class="bold">TACTICAL</span> – these workouts consist of mix of high-intensity cardio and power exercises that you have to do in order, without any breaks for the rest. These workouts provide excellent cardio, endurance and strength training all in one and prepare your body for function in extreme physical conditions.</li>
